    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>coconut rice is made with coconut flakes (or grated or desiccated/dry coconut). One way to make this dish is to make the rice separately (preferably using a rice variety which is light and fluffy when cooked) and then mixing it with the coconut mixture (coconut flakes toasted in sesame/coconut oil and spiced with paprika, nuts, curry powder/leaves and other spices).  </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5-7 cups of cooked, cooled white long grain rice(light and fluffy)</li>
        <li>0.5 cup of fresh/frozen grated coconut or dry coconut flakes</li>
        <li>2 dry red chilies</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black mustard seed</li>
        <li>7-10 curry leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Chana dhal</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon oil</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>a few cashews</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice and cook it (either in rice cooker or over the stove) until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Let it cool and firm up a bit. May also use leftover white rice from previous day.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil with the mustard seeds in a covered saute pan.</li>
        <li>When the mustard seeds have finished popping, add the other ingredients and lightly toast them in the oil till they change to a golden color.</li>
        <li>Then add the seasonings to cooked rice, mix well and serve.</li>
    </ol>
